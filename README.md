# Communism.js

A library allowing workers to seize the means of production and allocate system resources fairly.

Once the revolution triumphs, all proceeds according to a five-minute plan. Each worker gets coupons
allowing them to make a set number of function calls. Once they've exhausted their coupons, they
must wait for the next five-minute plan.

### Ideas

* Seizing the means of production should do something special for functions like the arithmetic
  and geometric mean functions. Also for producer and consumer functions.

* "From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs" needs to be incorporated somehow

* Should the Proletariat be able to vote on the allocation?

* There needs to be a Gulag somewhere.

* The people should own the capital. Therefore, there must be restrictions on the use of capital letters
